# StickyChunk [![Build Status](http://ci.devonthe.rocks/buildStatus/icon?job=StickyChunk)](http://ci.devonthe.rocks/job/StickyChunk/)
StickyChunk is a standalone, server-side chunk persistence plugin for keeping your entities and blocks loaded. This plugin is quite early in development and so support, questions or requests can be made over on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Bd8Jj6V) server.

## Features

StickyChunk will have many features working during the public Alpha and Beta releases, but will not come into it's own light until the first official release. It's features shall include;

- The ability to create personal and world loaded chunks
- Regional selection with a configurable tool
- Configurable expiration dates on loaded chunks (For infrequent or abandoned players)
- Multiple connection-based or flat-file database types to choose from
- A configurable token system to load chunks with

### Important Notes

- This plugin is in the early stages; any pulls taken could be broken and should be used for testing. Branching will occur soon.
- An API will be created for this plugin to allow for integration in the future but that is planned for post-release date.
- Database migration will be handled by the code in the beta versions, so loss of data is nothing to worry about when acting as an early tester.
